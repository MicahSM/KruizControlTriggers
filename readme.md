Fill out the Variables in the samplejovivariables.txt to your proper answers.

Add whatever modules you want to use to the fileTriggers.txt in the Kruiz-Control-master folder.

Add sounds you want into the sounds folder (.wav, .mp3, or .ogg only please. .ogg seems to run poorly though)

I strongly recommend using Kruiz-Control-Configurator, if nothing else, to keep your Kruiz Control up to date.


Module Details:

==backgrounds==

  If you have a scene with multiple backgrounds, this module will allow you to randomly pick them using a chat Command, or as a Channel Point reward! It does require setting up the list in chat, using the !bgadd command.

  usage:

  !bgadd background1
   -- This adds background1 as a source that can be chosen for a random background.

==bankofjovine==

  I personally have 2 points systems, so I can have 1 that I have more direct control over. This allows people to get a bonus for that secondary point system once a day. (I use Twitch points and Stream Elements points)

==dice==

  !roll 1d20
    -- Rolls a certain number of sided dice, all added together

  !rollsplit 3d20
    -- Rolls a certain number of sided dice, shown individually

==entrysounds==

  Plays a sound from the sounds folder upon the first chat of specific chatters. This does require a bit of diving into this module, so not for the faint of heart.

==jukebox==

  Allows for music to be played in a seperate Kruiz Control thread. Dependency for music based modules.

==mediacontrols==

  Uses strm.tool to allow mods to play/pause my music, and skipping of music with channel points. Requires some setup.

==misc==

  This is really a catch all for my random stuff. Right now it makes monika dab on my screen, and has commands to show off your FFZ/BTTV emotes.

==pets==

  I have some pets on my stream that I toggle between with channel points. It's actually a super simple setup, but it does require editing the actual trigger if you wanted to use it for something.

==quotes==

  You can't change permissions for who can add quotes in StreamElements, so I went ahead and added this so my VIPs can add quotes.

==sfx==

  plays sfx when users pay channel points. I have a seperate folder for first fanfares, and I also include a limited "Budget" option that comes up every hour. Additionally, this is a seperate Kruiz Control thread if I want to play SFX from other modules.

==speedrun==

  I have a list of quickruns I offer as a points reward. This really essentially functions as a list I can easily mess with using KC commands, rather than making a ton in Stream Elements.

==startup==

  Posts to Discord when you go live if you type !live. Also is supposed to post if you have StreamElements set to post as yourself, and it automatically types in chat "YourName is Live".

==steamcleaning==

I have streams where we take a list of games and play about 15 minutes of them, and pick at random. This helps me keep track of what's been played, helps me allow people to spend points to impact how they choose games, and I just wanted to see if I could make something like it to practice a bit more.
