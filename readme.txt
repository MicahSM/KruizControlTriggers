Fill out the Variables in the samplejovivariables.txt to your proper answers.

Add whatever modules you want to use to the fileTriggers.txt in the Kruiz-Control-master folder.

Add sounds you want into the sounds folder (.wav, .mp3, or .ogg only please. .ogg seems to run poorly though)

I strongly reccomend using Kruiz-Control-Configurator, if nothing else, to keep your Kruiz Control up to date.
